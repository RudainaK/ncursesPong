# Desciption 
This was a small project I wrote over the summer after learning C in first year. It's a recreation of Pong that uses the ncurses library to make some of the graphics in the terminal a little easier to work with, as well as for keyboard controls. '

# How to run
To be honest I mostly know how to make it work on Linux (Ubuntu specifically) and macOS. On windows you can also use WSL to run it. You'll need the ncurses library. On mac it should be preintsalled. On Linux you can install it through the terminal. 

To compile, run:

```
gcc Pong.c -lncurses
```

in the terminal. Then run 

```
./a.out
```

Or you can call it whatever you want and run that.
